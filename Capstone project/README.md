# Problem Statement: [Predicting Molecular Properties](https://www.kaggle.com/c/champs-scalar-coupling)
To predict the NMR coupling constants given the atomic positions 

The original data can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/champs-scalar-coupling/data). However, for demonstration purposes we have provided a subset of the original data in this repository. The original data contains 85003 molecules for training and 45772 molecules for test submissions. Our sample files consist of a subset of 1000 randomly chosen molecules from the training set and 600 randomly chosen molecules from the test set.

Our jupyter notebooks have been configured to run on the sample files we have provided. In order to run them on the original data, it is easiest to download the orginal data from the link provided above and replace our sample files with original data. Also, rename the original files as follows

train.csv --> train_sample.csv

test.csv  --> test_sample.csv

structures.csv --> structures_sample.csv
